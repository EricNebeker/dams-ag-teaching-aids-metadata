  "schema:name": "40 This is the four ton gantry crane located above the \"primary louver\" which separates fish from the canal. Note three pick-up points on intake baffles along the primary louver and one at the far end. These take fish and a little bit of water through 36 inch pipelines to secondary louver in background. The secondary louver further condenses fish into a smaller amount of water proportionate to cubic foot of water per fish. The efficiency of this louver system is quite high, however some fish do get through by evading these pick-up points or by coming upstream from the other end of the canal. The four ton gantry crane is used to lift the louver sections for cleaning depending on the amount of algae collected.",
